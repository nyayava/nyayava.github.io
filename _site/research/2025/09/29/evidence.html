    <p>This is a continuation of the 8-fold path for policy analysis described in <em>A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis</em> by Eugene Bardach and Eric M. Patashnik (6th edition, 2020). This section is on gathering evidence: information that helps answer the problem you have defined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of your time doing a policy analysis is spent on two activities: thinking and hustling data that can be turned into evidence. Of these two activities, thinking is generally the more important, but hustling data takes much more time… the real-world settings in which policy analysis is done rarely afford the time for a research effort that would please a careful academic researcher. In fact, time pressure is probably almost as dangerous an enemy of high-quality policy analysis as is politically motivated bias, if not more so. Therefore, economize on your data collection activities. The key to economizing is this: try to collect only those data that can be turned into information that in turn can be converted into evidence. (p. 14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What data do we actually need to answer the problem?</strong> – I think it’s oftentimes helpful to think in this way from the end goal backward, regardless of how much data or resources you have.</p>

<p>This kind of <strong>backward thinking</strong> is also relevant in sectors like IT, where creepy surveillance-level data on user behavior (that subjects themselves are unaware of providing) is available. In fact, the abundance of data can make analysis overly shaped or biased by what’s already available, as opposed to what is actually needed. When faced with large data, there’s a temptation that you <em>must</em> use what you already have—why look elsewhere when you have so much here? If the data does include what’s needed, that’s fine, but even if it doesn’t, thinking about the ideal data helps you identify the gap between what you have and what you actually need, which in turn <strong>reveals potential biases</strong> your analysis may be prone to.</p>

<p>When getting better acquainted with the problem, review existing literature not only for the key findings but also for the <strong>study’s strengths, limitations, and relevance to your specific context</strong>. Were there data they wanted to collect but couldn’t? Perhaps you can consider collecting that data if possible. Was the study conducted in a particular location? What are the similarities and differences between that location and yours?</p>

<p>Exploring related problems can also be helpful. For example, when studying how to reduce neighborhood resistance to low-income housing (such a Berkeley example!), it may be useful to review literature on community resistance to seemingly unrelated issues like solid waste incinerators, which may show <strong>instructive similarities</strong>.</p>

<p>When gathering information, be intentional about <strong>researching perspectives from those who might disagree</strong> with your problem definition or proposed solutions. Their perspectives can help uncover blind spots and fill in missing viewpoints. I hadn’t thought about doing this so early in the analysis; I assumed it came after a policy idea was formed, during implementation, to reduce resistance from the public. But in fact, it should start from the problem-definition and problem-review stage, by gathering information not only from those you agree with, but also from those you disagree with or don’t yet understand.</p>
