This is a continuation of the reflection of the 8-fold path for policy analysis described in *A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis* by Eugene Bardach and Eric M. Patashnik (6th edition, 2020). This section is on projecting (or predicting) the outcome of each policy options.

If there is a single option that is better in all aspects considered, then there is no **trade-off among the outcomes of different options**. Some policy options are better in certain aspects, while others perform better in different areas in terms of the outcome (again, not to be confused with trade-offs among the options themselves). For example, instead of simply comparing “more police patrols” versus “new police vehicles,” compare the actual crime reduction each option might achieve and the cost savings they offer. 

Trade-offs often involve **balancing costs and benefits**, so it helps to **standardize metrics** in monetary terms to allow for direct comparison. However, some things, like the value of life, are difficult to quantify in dollars, so break-even threshold analysis can be used to determine the minimum benefits needed to justify the costs. 

Another helpful concept is the **margin**; the smallest incremental change in cost, and comparing the corresponding change in outcome. For example, what cost is required to achieve an additional X units of outcome? Then, compare this cost-effectiveness across different options. 

Then comes the step to **narrow the list** to the most promising options using a base scenario as a reference point. The base scenario doesn’t have to be business as usual; it can reflect the outcome of a policy that has already been implemented. The final, narrowed list (which can contain multiple options) should be both relatively effective and feasible to implement.
