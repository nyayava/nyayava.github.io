This is a continuation of the reflection of the 8-fold path for policy analysis described in *A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis* by Eugene Bardach and Eric M. Patashnik (6th edition, 2020). This section is on deciding on one policy among the narrowed list constructed in the previous step.

This step is about making a final call on the “best” policy, acting as if you are the decision maker. Compare the outcomes of the narrowed options, weighing costs, benefits, and risks. If the choice is unclear, it may signal unresolved trade-offs or uncertainties that need refining, which in that case revisit the previous step. Also, apply the “twenty-dollar-bill” test: if the policy seems so good, why hasn’t it already been adopted? This can help uncover hidden barriers or resistance.
