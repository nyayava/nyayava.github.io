This is a continuation of the reflection of the 8-fold path for policy analysis described in *A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis* by Eugene Bardach and Eric M. Patashnik (6th edition, 2020). This section is on communicating your policy option to your client.

Now is the time to communicate your policy option to your audience, which could be your client. The purpose is to explain your analysis of the policy (by analysis, we mean the cost-benefit and trade-off analysis, not the outcomes after implementation) and to convince them that this is the best option. This stage involves dialogue, and I think itâ€™s possible your client may not be fully convinced or may raise new issues that need to be addressed. You may need to revisit previous steps to address their concerns and complete the story.
