This is a continuation of the reflection of the 8-fold path for policy analysis described in *A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis* by Eugene Bardach and Eric M. Patashnik (6th edition, 2020). This section is on projecting (or predicting) the outcome of each policy options.

Projecting outcomes means making a **reasonable prediction about the results** of implementing a policy using sound methods. This can include building statistical models to estimate outcomes, applying common sense to suggest feasible ranges, or using qualitative reasoning such as case studies. The projection should include both the magnitude of the expected outcome and the uncertainty around it, often expressed as a range rather than a single point estimate.

- One useful approach is **break-even (threshold) analysis**, which **sets a minimum bar for success** by answering the question: “What is the least the policy must achieve to justify its cost? For example, if you have $1 million to reduce juvenile crime, you might ask whether a 1%, 5%, 10%, or 15% reduction would be enough to justify that investment. Then, you assess whether the policy can realistically achieve this minimum threshold, evaluate its plausibility, estimate the probability of failure, and consider the costs of accepting that failure. 

- **Sensitivity analysis** tests how outcomes change when input assumptions or variable values vary. It helps determine how much an assumption can change before the policy result falls outside the desired range. 

- When exact predictions aren’t feasible, **scenario-based robust policy analysis** can be used. This method compares a policy’s performance, without requiring precise predictions, across multiple future scenarios to identify options that perform reasonably well under a wide range of possible futures. This approach can be used for climate policy problems, where long-term analysis is required but the probability distribution of future climate outcomes is highly uncertain. 

- When projecting outcomes, beware of **optimism bias**; it’s the tendency to overlook risks and failures. Be realistic about potential future problems like budget cuts or unintended side effects. 

- I think there is also a phenomenon where implementing a policy can change people’s behavior that then affects the policy outcome. 

I'm interested in learning about qualitative methods for predicting outcomes, and in comparing them with quantitative approaches to understand when each is most useful. 

There are a few more topics in this chapter, but I’ll leave it here for now.
