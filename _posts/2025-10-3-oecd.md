This is a summary and reflection on trade policies, as well as OECD's efforts to prevent illicit trade. 


#### Trade policy: methods and impacts 
Trade policy refers to the rules and regulations a country uses to manage its imports, exports, and international economic relationships. These regulations directly affect how much countries export and import, which in turn impacts GDP, food prices (both domestically and internationally), producer income, food security, and even environmental outcomes, depending on the types of production practices the regulations encourage or discourage. 

- One core element of trade policy is **tariffs**, or import duties – taxes placed on goods entering the country. The mechanism is: the U.S. importer pays the tariff to the government, then raises the price charged to U.S. customers to cover that cost, U.S. consumers pay more. Because imported goods become more expensive, the volume of foreign products entering the market typically decreases. 

    Potential pros of tariffs include generating government revenue through the collection of import taxes. Tariffs also encourage consumers to purchase domestically produced goods, which can boost domestic industries and create more domestic jobs. This can strengthen economic security by reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, especially for critical or strategic goods. 
    
    Potential cons of tariffs include placing a financial burden on consumers, who end up paying higher prices for imported goods. If domestic producers cannot scale up production quickly, this could lead to shortages of products. Tariffs can also trigger retaliation from other countries, which may impose their own tariffs in response, possibly hurting exporters by reducing the amount of goods they’re able to sell abroad. Also, with reduced competition from foreign producers, domestic industries may become less efficient, which can harm the domestic economy over time. 


- While tariffs on imports limit goods coming into a country, **taxes on exports** restrict goods leaving. 
    
    Like import tariffs, export taxes generate government revenue, as exporters must pay a tax to sell abroad. Because it becomes more expensive to export, producers may be incentivized to sell domestically, which can help stabilize local prices. 
    
    However, to stay competitive in foreign markets, exporters often lower their prices, reducing their net revenue. Over time, this can hurt producers’ income. Smaller export volumes can also lead to loss of international buyers, who may switch to more stable and reliable suppliers elsewhere.
