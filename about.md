Nyayava is a word I dreamed up to mean 'a cat's imagination', it doesn't exist ... yet. It's a mashup of nya (にゃ), the Japanese meow, and uyava (уява), the Ukrainian word for imagination. I wish I could understand the mysterious thoguhts of a cat and communicate with them. For now, this blog is written by a homo sapiens who embraces the lifestyle of an indoor cat. 

Some posts are in English, while others are in Japanese.
